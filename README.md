# HayDay
HayDayBot

I've create this for two reasons: 

1. The two other packages on GitHub for HayDay are viruses (bad ones at that).
2. It's a game to prays on your patience, so it's fun to automate.

Finally, I will not provide the full automation script as it's against terms of service. 
I will however, show the full work to get there. 

As per any automation problem we should break down the exercise:

## InfiniFarm

- Automatically detect the soil
- Plant Wheat (most profitable)
- Sell during growth (downtime)
- Harvest
- Repeat
